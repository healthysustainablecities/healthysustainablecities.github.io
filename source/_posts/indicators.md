The theoretical framework for our policy and spatial indicators for healthy and sustainable cities was outlined in the [*Lancet Global Health* Series on Urban Design, Transport and Planning](https://www.thelancet.com/series/urban-design-2022).

# Policy indicator analysis
Our [policy checklist](../resources/gohsc-policy-indicator-checklist.xlsx) tool has now been updated to support the [1000 Cities Challenge](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/1000cities).

For more information on the concepts underlying the tool, see:

# Spatial indicator analysis
Our open source [Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators](https://github.com/healthysustainablecities/global-indicators) software supports users to calculate and report on spatial and policy indicators for healthy and sustainable cities.  

See the directions on [Analysis and Reporting](../software/) for more details.

The software was developed by the [Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators Collaboration](https://www.healthysustainablecities.org/about#team) team, an international partnership of researchers and practitioners, extending methods developed by the [Healthy Liveable Cities Lab](https://cur.org.au/research-programs/healthy-liveable-cities-group/) at RMIT University and incorporating functionality from the [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) tool developed by Geoff Boeing.

Our framework is described in:

Liu S, Higgs C, Arundel J, Boeing G, Cerdera N, Moctezuma D, Cerin E, Adlakha D, Lowe M, Giles-Corti B (2022) A Generalized Framework for Measuring Pedestrian Accessibility around the World Using Open Data. Geographical Analysis. 54(3):559-582. https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12290

The tool was designed to be used for a 25-city comparative analysis, published as:

Boeing G, Higgs C, Liu S, Giles-Corti B, Sallis JF, Cerin E, et al. (2022) Using open data and open-source software to develop spatial indicators of urban design and transport features for achieving healthy and sustainable cities. The Lancet Global Health. 10(6):e907–18. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00072-9

The theory and process of scaling up residential analysis of liveability and sustainability indicators for diverse urban contexts and audiences is the topic of Carl Higgs' PhD research.  The following article details the challenges and lessons learned through scaling a spatial urban indicators research programme from Melbourne, Australia, to Australia's capital and regional cities, to cities in diverse contexts internationally:
